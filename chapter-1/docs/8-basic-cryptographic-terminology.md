## Basic Cryptographic Terminology

### Encryption domains and codomains

* *A* denotes a set called the *alphabet of definition*.

```
A = {0, 1} is the binary alphabet
```

The binary alphabet is frequently used, we can encode strings and messages.


* *M* denotes a set called the *message space*.

The message consists of strings and symbols made up of the *alphabet of definition*.
An element of *M* is referred to as a *plain text message* or simply *plain text*.

* *C* denotes a set called the *cipher text space*.

The cipher text space consists of the *alphabet of definition* that differs from the *message space*.
An element of the *cipher text space* is known as a *cipher text message*.
