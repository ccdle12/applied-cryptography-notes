## Bijections

A bijection is when each element in the set of X is mapped/transformed to an element in the set of Y.

The above image is not technically a bijection because all members of the set X must be transformed to each set of Y.

A bijection is when each element in the set of X is mapped/transformed to an element in the set of Y.

The above image is a bijection that maps/transforms set of X to Y.

*f* is the bijection from *X to Y*.

`f(x) = y`

G is bijection from Y to X.

`g(y) = x`

The inverse can be defined as:

`g = f^-1`

In cryptography bijections are used to encrypt a message. When we reverse a bijection we are decrypting a message.
