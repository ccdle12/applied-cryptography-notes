### Sets
Denoted as `X = {a, b, c}`

In other words *X is a set containing a, b, c*.

### One way, 1-1, Trapdoor
A function is defined by *x2 sets X and Y*.

A rule *f* assigns *each element of X to Y*.

```
X(a) → Y(1)
X is known as the Domain 
Y is known as the Codomain
```

### Members
`x ∈ X`

The above means that *x is a member-of the set X*.

### Images

The image of X is the mapping in Y according to the rule *f*.

The image y of x is noted as:

`y = f(x)`

### Standard Notation of a function

The standard notation for a function between the sets X to Y is denoted as:

`f: X → Y`

### PreImage

If y is a member of Y:

`y ∈ Y`

Then the preimage of y is x as a member of X:

`x ∈ X`

The preimage can be denoted as follows:

`f(x) = y`

Denotes that all the sets in y have at least one preimage:

`Im(f)`
