## The Four Main Goals of Cryptography

1. Confidentiality

    Keep the content of the information secret to only those who have authorization

2. Data Integrity

    The data sent and arrives as it was intended, without the data being tampered

3. Authentication Service

   When 2 parties being communication they prove/verify who they are

4. Non-Repudiation ***TODO: update this more***

    A service that prevents a party from denying previous actions.
